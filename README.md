test code for nc-first website

nc-first.renci.org is a website supporting an education and outreach program that trains public officials on how to interpret weather data.
It provides access to real-time weather data and presents it in dashboard format.
The data comes from feeds provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administation (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS), among others.

This test suite is a Work In Progress. It is written in python 2.7 and uses Selenium Webdriver to log into and test the website.
Tests will include:
	- All links work as expected
	- All data feeds are up and work as expected
	- Every element of the pages on the site can be clicked on/selected, and produce the expected display for that selection
The appropriate logging and reporting of successes and failures will be provided.
